## CONTENTS

<h2>Design</h2>

<h3>Colour Scheme</h3>

<p>In my css file I have used variables to declare colours, and then used these throughout the css file. I was recently introduced to this method during a code institute study and had some help from slack chat room - it is a useful convention to use as it allows you to alter the colour throughout the website if you decide to update a colour, by changing the colour once in the variable.</p>

<p>I have used  #E6ECF0 as the button background.</p><br>
<p> I have use #2222 for the hover background</p><br>
<p>I have used  #fff as the text colour</p>.<br>
<p>I have used #001e4d;; for the next button background</p><br>
<p>I have used rgb(127, 212, 164) to display the correct answer .</p>
<p>I have used #ee7272; to display the wrong answer .</p>
<p> i have use this #001e4d; for the game area h2 </p>
